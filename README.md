## Analysis
- **Arabica is the most popular coffee type** due to its smooth, complex flavor profile. It is among the most widely consumed coffees, with light and medium roasts being the most favored.
- **Arabica & Robusta (High Sales, Lower Price), Excelsa & Liberica (Lower Sales, Higher Price) -** While Arabica and Robusta are the best-selling coffee types, Excelsa and Liberica generate the highest profits due to their premium prices, which contribute substantially to overall revenue.”
- **94.2% of customers visited once and have not returned for up to 3 years**. This issue must be addressed seriously. This issue must be addressed urgently to keep the business afloat. Customer retention is crucial in the coffee supply industry, particularly since regular and consistent purchases are crucial for long-term success. If customers do not return after their first visit, it is important to investigate what’s hindering their return.
- **No loyalty card does not necessarily result in customer churn.** Regardless of their loyalty card status, customers are still likely to churn.


## Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Investigate reasons for customer churn**
    - Encourage customer feedback through email surveys. If customers are reluctant to do so, explore more creative ways to collect feedback, such as offering free sample giveaways or setting up a pop-up store where customers can sample different coffees. Engage with customers and observe to gather valuable insights regarding the quality and appeal of the beans.
1. **Target markets and product focus**
    - Focus on promoting Arabica, Excelsa and Liberica to US buyers, as they generate the most profit.
    - Highlight premium beans, such as Excelsa and Liberica as these types contribute significantly to overall profits. Emphasise their unique characteristics to attract more customers.
1. **Customer management to maintain a competitive edge**
    - **Know your loyal customers & their journeys,** and ensure consistency in providing personalised service, such as rewarding their loyalty. For customers who need more attention, enhance engagement using marketing communication tools and foster an emotional connection. Keep track of competitors and their offers, such as discount coupons or free shipping deals, to maintain a competitive edge.
